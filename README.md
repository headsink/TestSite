# A place to test Nodejs and more as a beginner with the magic of VSCode.

## first.js

[The JS file](first.js) was testing the [simple-icons library](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) to see how the output look like. It became the [Socmed Button Component](https://github.com/headsink/firstAstroSite/blob/master/src/components/SocmedButton.astro) in my [firstAstroSite Repo](https://github.com/headsink/firstAstroSite).

## Date Time test

The [datetimetest JS file](datetimetest.js) was for testing date time library because parsing date time format was not easy. Decision to choose which library to use was refered from [You don't (may not) need Moment.js](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs#string--date-format) Repo.
